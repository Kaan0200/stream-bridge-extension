# "SwitchStream"
A browser extension that connects online music stores to your preferred streaming service. 

*No more low quality samples, just listen directly to the song!* 🎧


## What is this?
Do you like browsing music through online webstores like Beatport, JunoDownload, Discogs, and more, but you hate having to listen to their tiny, low quality samples?  Then this is the extension for you. StreamSwitch tries to find the song you are looking at in a store-front on your prefered streaming service, allowing you to listen through the platform you already use while browsing somewhere else.
